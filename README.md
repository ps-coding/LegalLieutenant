# Legal Lieutenant
So many immigrant, low-income, and first-generation college students are overwhelmed with paperwork: immigration forms, employment documents, various contracts, the FAFSA, and more. Often, these students' families cannot afford dedicated legal counsel and struggle with the complicated language in those documents. Thus, Project: Empower South Jersey has created a solution: Legal Lieutenant.
